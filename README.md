# Oracle SQL Developer

In this project, I utilized SQL queries in SQL Developer to perform data analysis and visualization tasks. 
The main objectives were to aggregate revenue data based on different grouping criteria, export a table as JSON files, and visualize the results using Microsoft Power BI.
It demonstrated my ability to extract insights from data and present them in a visually appealing and informative manner.
